  # We only apply this object validator on non-excluded namespaces, which have
  # the "included-namespace" label set by the HC reconciler, so that when HNC
  # (webhook service specifically) is down, operations in the excluded
  # namespaces won't be affected. Validators on HNC CRs are not filtered because
  # they are supposed to prevent abuse of HNC CRs in excluded namespaces.
  # Namespace validator is not filtered to prevent abuse of the included-namespace
  # label on excluded namespaces. Unfortunately, this means that when HNC is
  # down, we will block updates on all namespaces, even "excluded" ones, but
  # anyone who can update namespaces like `kube-system` should likely be able to
  # delete the VWHConfiguration to make the updates.

  # This overwrites the rules specified in the object validator to patch object

  # There's no way to just patch "scope: Namespaced" to the first rule, since
  # `rules` takes a list of rules and we can only patch the entire `rules`.
