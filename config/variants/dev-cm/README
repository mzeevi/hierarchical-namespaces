This directory is the default configuration of HNC, except that it's configured
to use cert-manager ("cm" = "Cert Manager") instead of the internal
cert-controller. It's published as "default_cm.yaml" when
building the manifests ("made manifests" in the root directory).

As of March 2022, I (aludwin@google.com) have not actually tested this to see if
it works.

If/when we next need to use CRD conversion webhooks, add the following patches
to this directory:

# The following patch adds a directive for certmanager to inject CA into the CRD
# CRD conversion requires k8s 1.13 or later.
